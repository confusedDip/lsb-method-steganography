# Digital Image Steganography using LSB Method

A simple Python-based program implementing the Digital Image Steganography using LSB Method. Image Steganography is the technique of hiding text data in a digital image in such a way such that from bare eyes it is not possible to tell whether the image contains some secret text hidden in it. Out of the many techniques, one of the most basic and simple technique is the LSB (Least Significant Bit) Method.

In this notebook, the LSB Method has been implemented for hiding a text data in an image, and, given such an image, how the hidden data can be retrieved.
